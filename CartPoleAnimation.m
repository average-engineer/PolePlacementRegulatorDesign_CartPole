function CartPoleAnimation(w,L)

% Function for animating the response of the Cart Pole System
% xc and yc are considered the centre of the cart box
% xb and yb are considered the free end coordinates of the Pole
% yc is considered zero
% xc is the same as the horizontal position of the cart
% w is the calculated state vector of the system
% L is the pole length
